### Home server config management!

Some ansible and shell scripts to help me restore a home server to a desired state in case of disaster.

### Usage:
 1. Clone the repo.
 2. Run the main playbook
 3. Run the plex playbook
 4. Run the torbox playbook to orchestrate transmission-openvpn docker container from [here](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn)

 Thanks goes to haugene for making the awesome docker container!
