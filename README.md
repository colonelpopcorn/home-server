# Home Kubernetes Cluster - WIP

Trying to set up some automation scripts to quickly bootstrap a [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) cluster with [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik) as an ingress controller. I also want to put deployment manifests for common services in the scripts folder.
